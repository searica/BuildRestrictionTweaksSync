# BuildRestrictionTweaksSync
A building mod that lets you customize restrictions related to build piece placement.
This version is a fork of the mod by aedenthorn that adds the option of installing the
mod on the server to allow for syncing the configuration for all clients.

## Description
This mod adds the following config toggles related to build piece placement:

- DisableAllRestrictions
- IgnoreBlockedbyPlayer
- IgnoreInvalid
- IgnoreBuildZone
- IgnoreSpaceRestrictions
- IgnoreTeleportAreaRestrictions
- IgnoreMissingStation
- IgnoreBiomeRestrictions
- IgnoreCultivationRestrictions
- IgnoreDungeonRestrictions


If DisableAllRestrictions is set to true, building will never be restricted except in private zones.

## Configuration
A config file BepInEx/config/Searica.Valheim.BuildRestrictionTweaksSync.cfg is created after running the game once with this mod.

You can adjust the config values by editing this file using a text editor or in-game using the Configuration Manager. The mod has a built-in file watcher so either method will work and changes will be reflected in-game as you change the settings.

## Donations/Tips
My mods will always be free to use but if you feel like saying thanks you can tip/donate.

If you would like to provide suggestions, make feature requests, or reports bugs and compatibility issues you can either open an issue on the Github repository or tag me (@searica) with a message on my discord [Searica's Mods](https://discord.gg/sFmGTBYN6n).

 I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will always respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain the mod in my free time.

### Credits
