# BuildRestrictionTweaksSync
A building mod that lets you customize restrictions related to build piece placement.
This version is a fork of the mod by aedenthorn that adds the option of installing the
mod on the server to allow for syncing the configuration for all clients.

## Description
This mod adds the following config toggles related to build piece placement:

    DisableAllRestrictions
    IgnoreBlockedbyPlayer
    IgnoreInvalid
    IgnoreBuildZone
    IgnoreSpaceRestrictions
    IgnoreTeleportAreaRestrictions
    IgnoreMissingStation
    IgnoreBiomeRestrictions
    IgnoreCultivationRestrictions
    IgnoreDungeonRestrictions


If DisableAllRestrictions is set to true, building will never be restricted except in private zones.

## Configuration
A config file BepInEx/config/Searica.Valheim.BuildRestrictionTweaks.cfg is created after running the game once with this mod.

You can adjust the config values by editing this file using a text editor or in-game using the Config Manager﻿. The mod has a built-in file watcher to either method will work and changes will be reflected in-game as you change the settings.
